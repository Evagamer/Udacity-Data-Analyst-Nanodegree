# Titanic Data Visualization


## Summary
This project involves visualization of Titanic survival using passenegers data such as class, gender and age group. Created total three graphs first using **Class**, secong using **Age group** and third using both **Gender** and **Class**.

## Feedback
### To improve stack bar color
Color in the stacked bar chart can be improved. The color which are used are good but more conventional and sequential color can improve the visualization. 

### Reduce the width of bar chart
Reduce the width of stack bar chart for the second graph (Titanic Survival Rate by Age Group) so that it can be more clearly represent the age group.
